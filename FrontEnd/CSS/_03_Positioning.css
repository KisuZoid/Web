/*
position: static;
HTML elements are positioned static by default.

position: relative;
An element with position: relative; is positioned relative to its normal/supposed position.

position: fixed;
An element with position: fixed; is positioned relative to top left corner of browser window, it always stays in the same place even if the page is scrolled. The top, right, bottom, and left properties are used to position the element.

position: absolute;
An element with position: absolute; is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor --or-- (if position is not set to any of its ancestor) positioned top left corner of webpage. (instead of positioned relative to the viewport, like fixed).

Ex: <div class="1"> 
        this is the ancestor of div class 2.

        <div class="2">
            this is the descendent of div class 1. 
        </div>
    </div>

The z-index Property
    When elements are positioned, they can overlap other elements.
    The z-index property specifies the stack order of an element (which element should be placed in front of, or behind, the others).
    z-index only works on positioned elements (position: absolute, position: relative, position: fixed, or position: sticky) and flex items (elements that are direct children of display: flex elements).
