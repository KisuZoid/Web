    syntax:
    <img src="Source-Image_link" alt="Image-Description"/>
        i.e. <img src="https://picsum.photos/200/100"/>
                Source_Image_link: https://picsum.photos/

                for using picsum image, we have to define size as well:
                    size-of-Image: 200 by width(horizontal) and 100 by length(Vertical)
                        if we use only one value: https://picsum.photos/200
                            means size-of-Image: 200 * 200 by length and width
                Image-Description is must for better experience, it describe the property or name of image.
                    when the image will failed to upload, "that description will gonna display"

    "it doesn't have closing tag, it is a self closing tag"
